                    <h1>About me</h1>
                     <p>hi i'm CATBYTE or just cat! </p>
                    <p>i'm a multimedia artist, webmaster and cat person from the northeastern usa. i spend a majority of my free-time time indulging in creating things and exploring the net.</p><p>typically i wear a lot of different hats. learning new random skills to add to my repertoire is a hobby in itself for me.  
                    <p>i also *thoroughly* enjoy gaming, complaining about the temperature and early morning wake-ups. i am also currently nearing the end of finishing up a bachelor's degree in film. i probably don't have any good movie recommendations for you though.<br><br>
		                i primarily represent myself with my character that i share a namesake with, who you can learn more about on the "<a href="https://catbyte.site/oc/">my oc</a>" page, and this is what i'm up to right <a href="https://catbyte.site/about/now">now</a>. you can also get in contact with me <a href="https://catbyte.site/contact/">here</a> if you'd like.</p><br>

                    <h1>About the website</h1>
                    <p>i originally bought this domain, "catbyte.site" to be a redirect to my commission wix site at the time. i thought it was funny because it rhymes! i never expected it to turn into such a large part of my online identity.
                    <p>growing up, the internet was an invaluable source of information, connection, and sometimes just a good laugh. i spent my time on forums, exploring virtual worlds and creating art.</p>
                    <p>i guess the natural progression of that time spent was wanting to eventually carve out a space of my own.</p>
                    <p>there is something special about digital connection. the manmade ability to connect with individuals we would of otherwise never been able to. widespread communication and connection through wire and cable, in multiple different modalities. it's a spectacle not lost on me.</p>
                    <p>as dystopian as the modern internet may seem to grow, nothing can take away what always made the internet special. this is not to say to turn a blind eye in this hostile and over-monetized state of the modern web, but rather to embrace reclamation of the internet as a home for connection.</p>
                    <p>i finally made my website after browsing and being inspired by other people in the indie web space. after stumbling across so many lovingly crafted personal sites i was awestruck. seeing the products of the work that others put into their little corners of the internet made any hesitation i had around learning to build my own disappear. </p>
                    <p>that's when i knew my vision for "catbyte.site", and that's when it stopped being a redirect and became my reclamation of the internet.</p>
                    <p>the websites been under construction ever since. it'll likely always continue to be so, as i want it to be a flexible project that'll continue to grow with me. </p>
                    <p>i hope through this website i make something my younger self would've been proud of, or at least found cool, and i hope you enjoy your time here.</p>
